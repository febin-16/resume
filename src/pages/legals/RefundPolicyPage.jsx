          We understand that circumstances may arise where participants may need to cancel their registration for Hestia 24 events. We have developed the following refund policy to address such situations:
        </p>
        <h1 className='text-2xl text-[#FBF0C2] font-semibold p-2 text-left no-underline '>Faulty Registration</h1>
        <p className='text-lg text-[#FBF0C2] p-2 text-left leading-9'>
          If there is an error in registration due to technical issues or system errors, participants may request a refund of their registration fees. The refund will be processed within 7 business days of the request.
        </p>
        <h1 className='text-2xl text-[#FBF0C2] p-2 font-semibold text-left no-underline '>Event Cancellation</h1>
        <p className='text-lg text-[#FBF0C2] p-2 text-left leading-9'>
          In the event that Hestia 24 cancels an event, participants will be entitled to a full refund of their registration fees.
        </p>
        <h1 className='text-2xl text-[#FBF0C2] font-semibold p-2 text-left no-underline '>No-show or Withdrawal</h1>
        <p className='text-lg text-[#FBF0C2] p-2 text-left leading-9'>
          Once registered for an event, participants are expected to attend and participate as scheduled. If a participant is unable to attend or participate, the registration fees are non-refundable.
        </p>
        <h1 className='text-2xl text-[#FBF0C2] font-semibold p-2 text-left no-underline '>Refund Process</h1>
        <p className='text-lg text-[#FBF0C2] p-2 text-left leading-9'>
          All refund requests must be made by email to the address provided on the Hestia 24 website. Refund requests must include the participant's name, registration details, and reason for the request. Refunds will be processed using the original payment method, and may take up to 7 business days to appear in the participant's account.
        </p>
        <h1 className='text-2xl text-[#FBF0C2] font-semibold p-2 text-left no-underline '>Amendments</h1>
        <p className='text-lg text-[#FBF0C2] p-2 text-left leading-9'>
          Hestia 24 reserves the right to amend this refund policy at any time without notice. Participants are responsible for reviewing the policy periodically to ensure compliance.
        </p>
        <p className='text-lg text-[#FBF0C2] p-2 text-left leading-9'>
          By registering for and/or participating in Hestia 24 events, participants acknowledge that they have read, understood, and agreed to this refund policy.
